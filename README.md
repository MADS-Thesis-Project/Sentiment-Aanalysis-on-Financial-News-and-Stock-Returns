# Analysis on Impact of Financial News and Ratings Headlines Sentiment on Stock Price Returns and Risk

We want to determine whether there is a correlation between the news sentiment and stock fluctuation in which mediately affects investors actions. For this project, we will be looking into the sentiment results from financial news headlines and some cross-section stock fluctuation overtime relying on the visualization techniques to illustrate the correlations.

We clearly know that there are many factors affecting the stock fluctuation. In our analysis, we assume that the people transforming the news sentiments into trading actions are non-professional investors, who sell with negative news and buy with positive news. We will not go into the sentimental causation of actions happening in people. We infer that the strong news sentiments affect these investorsâ€™ judgement and action significantly as result, and then causes the stock fluctuation after the rapid butterfly effect happening on trading.
